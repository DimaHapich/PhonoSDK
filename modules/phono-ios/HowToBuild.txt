to build phonoNative-ios from git - assuming xcode is installed

1) git clone https://github.com/phono/PhonoSDK.git
2) cd PhonoSDK/modules/phono-phonegap-ios 
3) ant ;  this builds the low level audio library
4) cd ../phono-ios
5) ant ; build the PhonoNative library.

6) VisIVR contains an (ugly) iphone app that uses the API.
You can use this as a starting point to build something prettier.
