There are (at least) 2 ways
to build phonoNative-ios from git - assuming xcode is installed

Commandline method (requires phonegap 1.7 to be installed) :

1) git clone https://github.com/phono/PhonoSDK.git
2) cd PhonoSDK/modules/phono-phonegap-ios 
3) ant ;  this builds the low level audio library
4) cd ../phono-ios
5) ant ; build the PhonoNative library.

6) VisIVR contains an (ugly) iphone app that uses the API.
You can use this as a starting point to build something prettier.

GUI method (assumes you will only use native phono):

1) git clone https://github.com/phono/PhonoSDK.git
2) cd 3rdParty  
3) git clone https://github.com/steely-glint/XMPPFramework.git
4) cd ..
5) open PhonoIOSNative.xcworkspace in xcode 
6) build VisIVR which contains an (ugly) demo app that uses the API.
