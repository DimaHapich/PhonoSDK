There are (at least) 2 ways
to build phonoNative-ios from git - assuming xcode is installed


GUI method (assumes you will only use native phono):

1) git clone https://github.com/phono/PhonoSDK.git
2) cd PhonoSDK/modules/phono-ios/3rdParty  
3) git clone https://github.com/steely-glint/XMPPFramework.git
4) cd ..
5) open PhonoIOSNative.xcworkspace in xcode 
6) build VisIVR which contains an (ugly) demo app that uses the API.

To build the self standing libraries you will need to build your own 
app using ant:
1) git clone https://github.com/phono/PhonoSDK.git
2) cd PhonoSDK/modules/phono-ios 
3) ant 
4) This should put all necessary files into PhonoSDK/target/sdk/plugins/native-ios
5) add the Headers and library to your xcode project along with the tricksy -lxml2 ( see here - https://github.com/robbiehanson/KissXML/wiki/GettingStarted) 

6) VisIVR contains an (ugly) iphone app that uses the API.
You can use this as a starting point to build something prettier.
