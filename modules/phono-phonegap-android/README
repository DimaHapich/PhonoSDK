DISCLAIMER
  - Libraries included in this release are experimental so use AT YOUR OWN RISK
  - Please do not deploy these applications to 'Play' or other appstores until we announce the final release

  - This version supports Phonegap (aka Cordova) 1.7
  - This version has been tested on android 2.3.6 on a galaxy Y Duo 
  
Enough of that, let's get started...

Adding Phono support to an an existing PhoneGap project
-------------------------------------------------------

1. Add the Phono Plugin
   - Copy the contents of libs to your PhoneGap libs directory. This includes:
      armeab/libg722.so
      phonogap.jar
      srtplight.jar
    
2. Copy 'jquery.phono.js' to your PhoneGap 'www' directory and include it in your app (e.g. index.html)

3. Add the following to your res/xml/plugins.xml 
   <plugin name="PhonogapAudio" value="com.phono.android.phonegap.Phono"/>

4. In res/xml/cordova.xml give access to the phono gateways :
    <access origin="http://phono.com" subdomains="true"/>
    <access origin="http://voxeolabs.net" subdomains="true"/>


You're now ready to use Phono as you would in a standard web application, but use phonegap's 'deviceready' callback
to install your Phono instance in place of jquery's $(document).ready() .

If this is your first Phono application, check out our awesome documentation here: http://phono.com/docs

If this is your first phonegap project - please read phonegap/README.md
We have bundled the necessary phonegap files in the phonegap directory.

Also bundled is a pre-built kitchen sink app see artifacts/sdk/samples/mobile/
