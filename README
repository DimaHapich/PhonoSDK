The Phono SDK provides an object-oriented JavaScript API for embedding two-way audio and chat onto any web page. The Phono SDK is a pure client-side solution and requires zero server-side logic on your part; all communication is handled transparently by the Voxeo Cloud. In the near future we will release a downloadable Phono Gateway that allows Phono to connect to any SIP Voice over IP infrastructure directly without the Voxeo cloud.
